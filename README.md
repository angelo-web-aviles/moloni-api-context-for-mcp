## Getting Started

To get started with the Moloni API, you can visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/angelo-web-aviles/moloni-api-context-for-mcp/releases) to download the latest version of the documentation. After downloading, follow the instructions to set up your environment and begin exploring the API.

## Endpoints Overview

### Authentication

Authentication is the first step to using the Moloni API. You need to obtain an access token to interact with the API. Below are the steps to authenticate:

1. **Request Token**: Send a POST request to the authentication endpoint.
2. **Receive Token**: The response will include your access token.

**Example in curl**:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.moloni.pt/v1/authenticate \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "username": "your_username",
  "password": "your_password"
}'
```

**Example in JavaScript**:

```javascript
fetch('https://api.moloni.pt/v1/authenticate', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    username: 'your_username',
    password: 'your_password'
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```

### Company Management

Managing company information is essential for any business. The Moloni API allows you to create, read, update, and delete company data.

**Example in curl**:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.moloni.pt/v1/companies \
-H "Authorization: Bearer your_access_token" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "name": "Your Company Name",
  "address": "Your Address",
  "email": "your_email@example.com"
}'
```

**Example in JavaScript**:

```javascript
fetch('https://api.moloni.pt/v1/companies', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your_access_token',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'Your Company Name',
    address: 'Your Address',
    email: 'your_email@example.com'
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```

### Invoicing

Invoicing is a critical part of business operations. The Moloni API provides endpoints to manage invoices effectively.

**Example in curl**:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.moloni.pt/v1/invoices \
-H "Authorization: Bearer your_access_token" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "customer_id": "customer_id",
  "items": [
    {
      "description": "Item Description",
      "quantity": 1,
      "price": 100
    }
  ]
}'
```

**Example in JavaScript**:

```javascript
fetch('https://api.moloni.pt/v1/invoices', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your_access_token',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    customer_id: 'customer_id',
    items: [
      {
        description: 'Item Description',
        quantity: 1,
        price: 100
      }
    ]
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```

### Inventory Management

Keeping track of inventory is crucial for any business. The Moloni API allows you to manage your inventory seamlessly.

**Example in curl**:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.moloni.pt/v1/inventory \
-H "Authorization: Bearer your_access_token" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "product_id": "product_id",
  "quantity": 50
}'
```

**Example in JavaScript**:

```javascript
fetch('https://api.moloni.pt/v1/inventory', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your_access_token',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    product_id: 'product_id',
    quantity: 50
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```
